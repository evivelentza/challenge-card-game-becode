# 🃏 Card Game – OOP Practice in Python

A simple card game simulation built to practice Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

The goal was to generate a standard 52-card deck, shuffle it, distribute it among 4 players, and simulate turns where each player plays one card per round until no cards remain. There’s no scoring logic—this is purely an OOP exercise.
